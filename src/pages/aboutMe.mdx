# About Me


I am Nithin Varghese a passionate Deep learning/Computer Vision Engineer with a strong belief in the transformative power of AI. My mission is to harness the potential of artificial intelligence to create a more beautiful future for all.

## Professional Experience

### Lead Data Scientist at DeepSight AI Labs (Feb 2021 - Present)
At DeepSight AI Labs, a leading smart CCTV analytics company, I lead a talented team to deliver cutting-edge video analytics solutions. Some of my key projects include:

- **Coal India Video Analytics**: Led the project from conception to go-live, delivering solutions for PPE detection, fire detection, crowd counting, overmanning, tailgating detection, idle time, zone intrusion, and vehicle counting. The solution has been successfully deployed in major coal mines across India.

- **Wagon Tracking and Counting for HPCL**: Spearheaded the development of a CCTV-based wagon tracking and counting system to minimize human error rates in HPCL plants.

- **Edge-based Computer Vision Solutions**: Led the complete solution design and edge-based deployment of computer vision models for the banking and retail sectors.

- **Facial Recognition System**: Managed the end-to-end deployment of a facial recognition system.

- **Performance Optimization**: Significantly improved organization-wide platform performance by optimizing deep learning models for specific hardware using TFLite, TensorRT, and OpenVINO formats. Deployed optimized models on RPi, CPU, and GPU.

### Computer Vision Engineer at DeepSight AI Labs (Sep 2018 - Feb 2021) 
- Developed a novel algorithm for camera tamper detection.
- Trained and deployed models for masked face and helmet detection.
- Trained and deployed models for crowd detection use cases.

### Freelance Machine Learning Engineer (May 2018 - Aug 2018)
- Developed a receipt information extraction system that uses object detection techniques (YOLOv3) and an OCR pipeline to transform receipt images into CSV files.
